PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT
* raise your hand if you have a google account, gmail
* keep it raised if this is a primary or main account in your life; ie: if it's contents are important
* lower your hand if you use two-factor authentication
* DO IT NOW.





The beginning of the talk will escalate technically, starting with the basics and then getting into the more
complicated aspects of the language.  I'll cover basic syntax, objects, functions, execution scope, prototype inheritance,
the DOM, and browser events.

Next I'll move into "Tips from the Trenches" and share lessons learned and best practices from experience.
This will include things to avoid, things that make your life easier, and some recommendations for optimizations.

Finally, I'll wrap up with "Unsolicited Advice".  Ideas and observations about the practice of software
engineering that apply to development in any language.

# Optimizations #
* Graph of optimizations
"Let's talk about optimizations."
* Don't be penny-wise and pound-foolish.
Concat and minimize files.  Yes, you need to be doing this.
work your way down the list; prioritize the most expensive stuff first (HTTP requests!)
scripts at the bottom; CSS at the top
you basicaly cannot optimize CSS beyond avoiding some simple things - don't worry about it

I don't use coffeescript or LESS - old timer?  Or just don't need the syntax crutch.  Would prefer 100% compliance to the Closure Linter over alternate syntax.

You basically never need to modify the prototype unless you're building objects that need to be constructed (ie: a framework)

Data structures are your friend!  Show example of menu as a JS array vs markup (angle bracket tax)

TODO: copy the html5 slide info from google code to local repo


How to structure your pages
Show off UltimateCentral structure
The problems of global scope are the same as regular scope
at first when I read "The Good Parts" I thought some of his recommendations were pedantic; now I follow them basically 100% and add a few of my own
(do not agree about "continue")
when in doubt, be more explicit (true for any flexible language)


# Lesson1 - Basic Types, Objects, Arrays, Functions, RegExp #
> simple types: numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined
> all numbers are 64-bit floating point (Java double)
> everything else is an Object (functions, arrays, regular expressions, objects)
> functions are objects
> arrays are objects
> objects are objects
> don't do this - don't modify the global objects (exception: polyfills to "enhance" up to ECMA5)

Lesson2 - everything executes within an object scope
> show 3-layer hoisting example
> "this" example
> "var that = this;" example
> use "this" in the global scope; show how it's on the window object

Lesson3 - how prototypical inheritance works
> create 2 objects, one with .prototype and one without (.prototype doesn't create another instance in memory)
> create object, change one value, change the prototype, show how it's changed one object but not another (hoisting)

Lesson4 - things to know about functions
> required args and optional object - look at the Google style guide for this

Lesson6 - module pattern
> think in terms of scope; you're creating an isolated scope for your operation and exporting things out of that scope

Lesson7 - constructor pattern
> capitilize the first letter convention; any variable in javascript that starts with a capital letter should be a constructor (exception: CONSTANTS)
> write the object interface first; work backwards from there
> put functions in .prototype where possible


--- up to this point, everything has been pure JS ---

Lesson9 - The DOM
> Document Object Model - it's exactly what it sounds like.  representation of the document tree using JS objects
> show side by side JS and HTML
> browser exposes properties - they are not consistent
> use a framework to interact with the DOM
> Show native DOM properties vs framework abstracted DOM manipulation
> "Do you know all the universal properties off the top of your head? No? Then use a framework"

Lesson10 - The Browser
> browser gives us global functions and other methods (HTTPRequest, WebSockets, etc)
> some of these objects are consistent, some are not.  use libraries to abstract them to make consistent

Lesson11 - DOM Events
> explain the event loop
> show how events work
> explain event delgation

--- Tips from the trenches ---


1. Have a build process.
> Dev to production should be one-step.
> Minimize and concatenate files.
> rename to bust caches
> use Google Closure Linter to prevent errors
> in terms of optimizations, this stuff is huge.  almost nothing else you can do in JS or CSS will be more important than this step



> Create Global namespace for your project; put your shit in there
> anonymous scope for the page-level stuff, "export" event handlers out of that scope
> always prefer explicit to implicit (type conversion, naming, etc)
> "smart data, stupid code"  use data structures where possible.  especially frontend code should be full of data structures
> event delegation
> exit functions as early as possible (show a long if block vs early return / continue)
> need to show an example of how to use default values to functions, ie: foo = foo || 3;


# General Engineering Tips #

* Use source code control
* Have an automated build process.
* Use a bug tracking system.
* Develop on a server.
